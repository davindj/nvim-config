## üîß Requirement
Here's few importants requirements to use this config perfectly.

### OS Requirement
- MacOS or ANY Linux Distros
> For Windows User, I **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** to use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).  

<sub>*Just migrate to Mac or Linux will ya :)*</sub>

### Software Requirement
- **Neovim** <sub>(duh)</sub>. Get it on your favorite OS package manager such as brew (for MacOS), dnf, apt.
```sh
# for brew
$ brew install neovim

# to check wether proper neovim is properly installed
$ nvim --version
```
- **pynvim**. This is used by **ultisnips** engine for snippet.
```sh
$ python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pynvim
```
- **ripgrep**. This is used by **telescope** for `live_grep` features. You can install ripgrep in your OS Package Manager.
```sh
# for brew
$ brew install ripgrep
```

### LSP Requirement 
LSP is used to make your text editor smarter and have context of your codebase, or to make your text-editor become IDE. Since LSP for each programming language is different you can install your favorite programming languages LSP.
- **TSServer**. LSP for Javascript & Typescript. You'll need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
    ```bash
    # Install LSP
    $ sudo npm i -g typescript typescript-language-server

    # Check Path & Installation
    $ typescript-language-server --version
    ```
- **GOPLS**. LSP for Go. You'll need to install [go](https://go.dev).  
    Make sure `go/bin` is accessible in `$PATH`
    ```sh
    # ~/.zshrc
    export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin"
    ```          
    Install LSP
    ```bash
    # Install LSP
    $ go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest

    # Check Path & Installation
    $ gopls version
    ```
- **SourceKit**. LSP for Swift. For this LSP there are few ways to install it. For me the easiest way is to just install [xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), because xcode come with LSP. but you can see other installation method on [their official repo](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp). And after that make sure `sourcekit-lsp` is accessible in `$PATH`
    ```sh
    # ~/.zshrc
    export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/sourcekit-lsp"
    ```
_Notes: if installation succeed but you can't run that LSP, make sure that your LSP is accessible in `$PATH`_

### UI Requirement
This config use [nerdfont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads), so you'll need to set your terminal emulator font using nerdfont and enable ligature options.

1. Clone / download this project anywhere

2. Move config to nvim configuration folder `~/.config/nvim`
```sh
# make sure you backup your nvimconfig, otherwise it will be overwritten
